      <h2>a bit about myself...</h2>
      <p>It's very hard to say where I am from because I was born in California but 6years of my childhood was spent in Japan. However, many people who meet me for the first time will say that they see more of my Mexican personality than my Japanese personality. I grew up speaking three languages so I have always felt lucky to be able to communicate with many people from, different parts of the world. My parents always taught me the importance of staying healthy and active, so I always found hobbies that would keep me moving. For a couple of years, I trained alongst side professional Salsa dancers so my level of salsa dancing is better than average. My husband's family takes me to another level in my fitness because they are incredibiliy athletic and as a family race in Iron Mans. For this reason, during the pandemic, I bought myself a used road bike and started training so that I could keep up with the family I married into. Now, I'm obssessed with road biking and have become very strong because of it. My husband and I </p>
