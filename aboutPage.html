      <h2>a bit about myself...</h2>
      <p>I am Japanese and Mexican. I have a love for activities that strengthen my muscles. For a couple of years, I trained alongst side professional Salsa dancers and have performed in front of hundreds of people. I loved it! During the pandemic, I bought myself a used road bike and am looking forward to when I sign up for a triatholon. I just sold my mountain bike since its a buyers market right now but I also loved riding on Barton Creek Trails and the South Austin Trail Network.</p>
